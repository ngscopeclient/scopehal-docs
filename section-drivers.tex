\thickhline
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{akila}

This driver uses a raw binary protocol, not SCPI.

Under-development internal logic analyzer analyzer core for FPGA design debug. The ILA uses a UART interface to a host
system. Since there's no UART support in scopehal yet, socat must be used to bridge the UART to a TCP socket using
the ``lan" transport.

\subsection{aklabs}

This driver uses two TCP sockets. Port 5025 is used for SCPI control plane traffic, and port 50101 is used for waveform
data using a raw binary protocol.

\section{Demo}

The ``demo" driver is a simulation-only driver for development and training purposes, and does not connect to real
hardware.

It ignores any transport provided, and is normally used with the ``null" transport.

The demo instrument is intended to illustrate the usage of glscopeclient for various types of analysis and to aid in
automated testing on computers which do not have a connection to a real oscilloscope, and is not intended to accurately
model the response or characteristics of real world scope frontends or signals.

It supports memory depths of 10K, 100K, 1M, and 10M points per waveform at rates of 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 Gsps.
Four test signals are provided, each with 10 mV of Gaussian noise and a 5 GHz low-pass filter added (although this can
be disabled under the channel properties)

Test signals:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1.000 GHz tone
\item 1.000 GHz tone mixed with a second tone, which sweeps from 1.100 to 1.500 GHz
\item 10.3125 Gbps PRBS-31
\item 1.25 Gbps repeating two 8B/10B symbols (K28.5 D16.2)
\end{itemize}

\section{Digilent}

Digilent oscilloscopes using the WaveForms SDK are all supported using the ``digilent" driver in libscopehal. This
driver connects using the ``twinlan" transport to a \href{https://github.com/azonenberg/scopehal-waveforms-bridge}
{socket server} which links against the Digilent WaveForms SDK. This provides network transparency, and allows the
Digilent bridge server to be packaged separately for distribution and only installed by users who require it.

As of 2022-03-09, analog input channels on the Analog Discovery Pro and Analog Discovery 2 have been tested and are
functional, however only basic edge triggering is implemented so far. Analog inputs on other devices likely work,
however only these two have been tested to date.

Analog outputs, digital inputs, and digital outputs are currently unimplemented, but are planned to be added in the
future.

\section{DreamSource Lab}

DreamSourceLabs oscilloscopes supported in their fork of sigrok (``libsigrok4DSL'' distributed as part of their
``DSView'' software package) are supported through the ``dslabs'' driver in libscopehal. This driver connects using
the ``twinlan'' transport to a \href{http://todo.com/}{socket server} which links against libsigrok4DSL. This provides network
transparency, and allows the DSLabs bridge server to be packaged separately for distribution and only installed
by users who require it.

As of 2022-03-17, only a DSCope U3P100 has been tested and works adequately. Other DSCope-line products may work
also, but are untested. DSLogic devices are unlikely to work without further hacking on the bridge code.

Only edge triggers are supported (by the hardware.) ``Ch0 \&\& Ch1'' and ``Ch0 || Ch1'' trigger modes are not supported.

Known issues pending fixes/refactoring:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Interleaved sample rates are not correctly reported in the timebase dialog (but are in the waveform display)
	\item Trigger position is quantized to multiples of 1\% of total capture
	\item Some sample rate / depth configurations produce trigger position misreporting (seemingly from hardware) by
	       $\pm5$ samples.
	\item Non-localhost performance, and responsiveness in general may suffer as a result of hacky flow control on waveform capture
\end{itemize}

\section{Keysight}

Keysight devices support a similar similar SCPI command set across most device families. Many Keysight devices were
previously sold under the Agilent brand and use the same SCPI command set, so they are supported by the ``agilent"
driver.

Please see the table below for details of current hardware support:

\subsection{agilent}

\begin{tabularx}{16cm}{llX}
\thickhline
\textbf{Device Family} & \textbf{Driver} & \textbf{Notes} \\

\end{tabularx}

\section{Pico Technologies}

Pico oscilloscopes all have slightly different command sets, but are supported using the ``pico" driver in libscopehal.
This driver connects via a TCP socket to a socket server (azonenberg/scopehal-pico-bridge) which connects to the
appropriate instrument using Pico's binary SDK.

\begin{tabularx}{16cm}{llX}

Rigol oscilloscopes have subtle differences in SCPI command set, but this is implemented with quirks handling in the
driver rather than needing different drivers for each scope family.

\section{Rohde \& Schwarz}

There is partial support for RTM3000 (and possibly others, untested) however it appears to have bitrotted.

TODO (scopehal:59)

\section{Saleae}
TODO (scopehal:16)

\section{Siglent}

A driver for SDS2000X+ is available in the codebase which has been developed according to Siglent offical documentation
(Programming Guide PG01-E11A). This driver should be functional across the 'next generation' SDS2000X+, SDS5000X and
SDS6000X scopes . It has been developed using the SDS2000X+.

An old Siglent driver with significant bitrot is available in the git archive if required.\\

\begin{tabularx}{16cm}{lllX}
\thickhline
\textbf{Device Family} & \textbf{Driver} & \textbf{Transport} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\thickhline
SDS2000X+ series & siglent & lan & Basic functionality complete. Digital channels and advanced triggering remain to be added. \\
\thickhline
SDS5000X series & siglent & lan & Initialises, triggers and downloads waveforms. More testing needed \\
\thickhline
SDS6000X series & siglent & lan & Untested. Not available in Western Markets. \\
\thickhline
\end{tabularx}

No other Siglent scopes are supported at the moment although work is progressing on the SDS1000X-E series.

The only exception to this is the SDS3000X series which is expected to work using the LeCroy driver over vicp interface
as if it were a WaveSurfer 3000. User feedback appreciated.\\

\thickhline
\end{tabularx}

These figures were obtained from a SDS2104X+ running firmware version 1.3.7R5. Different scopes and software
revisions may vary. This series of scopes support sample depths up to 100MPoints, but depths beyond 10MPoints
require a different software interface and are likely to be extremely slow, so have not yet been implemented.

\section{Teledyne LeCroy / LeCroy}

Teledyne LeCroy (and older LeCroy) devices use the same driver, but two different transports for LAN connections.

While all Teledyne LeCroy / LeCroy devices use almost identical SCPI command sets, Windows based devices running
XStream or MAUI use a custom framing protocol (``vicp") around the SCPI data while the lower end RTOS based devices use
raw SCPI over TCP (``lan").

Please see the table below for details on which configuration to use with  your hardware.

\subsection{lecroy}

This is the primary driver for MAUI based Teledyne LeCroy / LeCroy devices.

This driver has been tested on a wide range of Teledyne LeCroy / LeCroy hardware. It should be compatible with any
Teledyne LeCroy or LeCroy oscilloscope running Windows XP or newer and the MAUI or XStream software.

\section{Tektronix}

This driver is being primarily developed on a MSO64. It supports SCPI over LXI VXI-11 or TCP sockets.

The hardware supports USBTMC, however waveform download via USBTMC does not work with libscopehal for unknown reasons.

Avoid using memory depths longer than 500K points with glscopeclient. The scope firmware will crash if you try and
require a full reboot.

\thickhline
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Note regarding ``lan" transport on MSO5/6}

The default settings for raw SCPI access on the MSO6 series use a full terminal emulator rather than raw SCPI
commands. To remove the prompts and help text, go to Utility | I/O, then under the Socket Server panel select protocol
``None" rather than the default of ``Terminal".
